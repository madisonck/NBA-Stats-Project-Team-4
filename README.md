Team 4 Project on NBA Statistics

Question 1: What is the correlation between the most tracked statistics in NBA (Assists, Points, 3 Pointers Made, Rebounds, Blocks & Steals) and playerâ€™s annual salary?  

Question 2: What does the Win/Loss record tell us about an organization's regular season success? Is one conference stronger than another? Do teams have a home field advantage?

Question 3: How does the home court advantage affect NBA statistics?
